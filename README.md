# Simple Roadmap from actual zero to somewhat Neovim user

## Prerequisite

1. Install [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
2. Install [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)

## DISCLAIMAR

*This is a roadmap of how to start your journey as a Neovim user from newbie (0 basics). It is not a how-to guide*

## Let the journey begins

We often make mistakes by jumping into a topic without realizing/knowing whether basics even exists or not. Many of us have faced this issue while we started learning Neovim.
In my case, I was inspired by @ThePrimeagen 's [0 to LSP : Neovim RC From Scratch](https://youtu.be/w7i4amO_zaE?si=mIerYRfspOk1KXQP)
and started following exactly what he did. However, just like me, most of us end up being a clueless dumb and ask ourselves why the hell on Earth do we even exist. As a result, many of us
just give up on learning Neovim. But we end up forgetting is that in order to learn Neovim, you must know how [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) actually works. Without knowing the basics
of vim, it is a never ending cluelessly walking loop. 

As I have mentioned earlier, this doc is just a roadmap for starting this crazy journey of Neovim and it is not a how-to guide. So, in order to start our Neovim journey we must learn
the basics of Vim and how it works. I have added resources for Vim's basic guidelines.
